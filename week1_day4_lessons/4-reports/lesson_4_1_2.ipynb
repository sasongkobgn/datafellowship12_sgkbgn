    "# Prediting Suicide Rates From Human Development Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Suicide is a complex social issue that touches many families and individuals.  Individual opinions on suicide are varied. Reasons for commiting or considering suicide are even more varied.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We all have those moments where we say to ourselves \"I should just kill myself.\"  These are not truly suicidal thoughts, just like \"I could kill him\" is not truly a call for murder. Those contemplating suicide may show certain behaviors that are often not recognized until after the suicide, others show no signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons for suicide can only be guessed at by those left behind from a note, behaviors, or other artifacts.  Others are well documented or can be decidely clear.  \n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "After several runs of the notebook, I reached a conclusion that there is no discernable connection between HDI and suicide rate. There is clear evidence that males have a higher suicide rate than females for the time periods in this dataset.  A general conclusion can be drawn that the older a person comes the greater chance they will commit suicide; however, older ages are fraught with medical conditions and that is more likely the cause for the increased suicide rate.  Finally, since 1995, suicide rates have been in decline.  2016 shows an uptick in the suicide rate, however, the countries in 2016 are mostly from an area I would call Eastern Europe and they seem to have a high scuicide rate for the three years examined here as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Study\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying the data from several runs indicates that the area of the world in which the country resodes may be a better  of suicide rates than HDI.  While the other trends, age, gender, etc., seem to hold true regradless of area of world, the suicide rates do appear to be higher in some areas than others.  For example, the area I would call Eastern Europe show high suicide rates, while the area I would call the Bahamas show low suicide rates.  This may be a function of government stability and war as opposed to living standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "To study this, a determination of areas of the world and the countries they comprise would have to be decided and then added to the dataset.  Then graphs of suicide rates by area could be examined.  "
